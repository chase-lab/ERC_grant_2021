# Global Restore Project

## Description
<!---This is the website description-->
The Global Restore Project is a collaboration of restoration researchers using the power of data to deliver better outcomes for restoration ecology.  
The group is interested in ecological community data, and will begin by focusing on grasslands, drylands and wetlands. As opposed to a traditional meta-analysis, which uses effect-sizes for analyses, and is thus an analysis of analyses, the global restore project is interested in building a database of raw data, allowing more flexibility and power for syntheses to take place to maximise the learning potential of this endeavor.
