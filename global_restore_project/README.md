# The Global Restore Project 
 
## Description

The Global Restore Project is a data aggregation that aims to collect fine-scale vegetation community monitoring data from 3 major types of sites. 1. sites that have been disturbed anthropogenically, where disturbance has ended and where an active restoration treatment has been applied (seeding or planting species mixes); 2. sites that have been disturbed and where disturbance has ended but no active restoration treatment has been applied; 3. reference sites that have never been disturbed.

164 datasets across over 1500 unique sites globally in grasslands, wetlands and forest ecosystems.

## Data aggregation rules
Data sets were originally searched for among Web of Science, Dryad, FigShare, LTER data sets, and the U.S. Forest Service Research Data Archive. Open data has been downloaded and have data citations, non-open data has been requested and contributed. Most papers have citations for original articles there were used for, some were used as part of reports  from grey literature or are unpublished.

## Working status
Continuously being updated, still being built.
 
## Publication status
Not ready to be published yet. 

A dryland subset of seeded data that was a part of the Global Arid Zone Project (GAZP) has been published as a part of the first paper to come out using these data. Indicated below
 
## Usage
Used in Global Arid Zone Project dryland subset team paper.
