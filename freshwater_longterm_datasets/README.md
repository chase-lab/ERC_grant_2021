# Freshwater_datasets

## Description
This data aggregation project aimed at gathering long term data, resembling
BioTIME typical data sets. We focused on freshwater ecosystems. (Only lakes for now) and included fish, phytoplankton and zooplankton communities (Maybe invertebrates later?)

## Data aggregation rules
Data sets were originally searched for among LTER data sets but absent from existing databases including BioTIME.

## Working status
Data last updated on March 8 2021.

## Publication status
Code available on GitHub [https://github.com/chase-lab/freshwater_datasets](https://github.com/chase-lab/freshwater_datasets).(Well the repository is actually private so invisible to everyone outside of the team)
