# Metacommunity time series

## Description
Metacommunity time series are an aggregation of data sets with similar structures
allowing analysing biodiversity patterns through time. It comprises subsets of
published databases RivFishTIME and BioTIME and a database we created: Homogenisation.



### Homogenisation
The homogenisation data set was designed to analyse biodiversity changes at alpha and gamma scales over time.
At the moment, 70 data sets are collated providing a total of 159 regional and 5679 local scale compositions. These data sets were sampled in freshwater, marine and terrestrial ecosystems and focused on fish, birds, plants, invertebrates, herpetofauna and mammals.


#### Data aggregation rules
Candidate data sets had to provide species composition of at least two local sites sampled in at least two distinct years. In some cases, sites were sampled every year following a standardised sampling design. These data sets are comparable to BioTIMEx, BioTIME or FragSAD structure. In other cases, we used checklists to get the composition of whole ecosystems like islands and these data sets did not provide species abundances.

#### Working status
Work in progress.

#### Publication status
Code available on GitHub [https://github.com/chase-lab/homogenisation](https://github.com/chase-lab/homogenisation). (Well the repository is actually private so invisible to everyone outside of the team)

#### Usage
Used in team manuscript: Local biodiversity change reflects interactions among
changing abundance, evenness and richness. Blowes, Shane; Daskalova, Gergana;

### BioTIME
Managed by Anne Magurran and colleagues in Saint Andrews university, BioTIME aggregates time-series of mostly marine but also terrestrial communities globally. Our team extensively collaborated with the BioTIME working group.

### RivFishTIME
The RivFishTIME effort lead to compiling a global database of long-term riverine fish surveys from 46
regional and national monitoring programmes and from individual academic research
efforts. The database includes 11,386 time-series of
riverine fish community catch data, including 646,270 species-specific abundance
records, together with metadata related to the geographical location and sampling
methodology of each time-series.
