# Homogenisation

## Description
The homogenisation data set was designed to analyse biodiversity changes at alpha and gamma scales over time.
At the moment, 70 data sets are collated providing a total of 159 regional and 5679 local scale compositions. These data sets were sampled in freshwater, marine and terrestrial ecosystems and focused on fish, birds, plants, invertebrates, herpetofauna and mammals.


## Data aggregation rules
Candidate data sets had to provide species composition of at least two local sites sampled in at least two distinct years. In some cases, sites were sampled every year following a standardised sampling design. These data sets are comparable to BioTIMEx, BioTIME or FragSAD structure. In other cases, we used checklists to get the composition of whole ecosystems like islands and these data sets did not provide species abundances.

## Working status
Work in progress.

## Publication status
