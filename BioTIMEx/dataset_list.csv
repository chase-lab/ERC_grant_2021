Three climate treatments have been applied to 3x3m plots:

1. Temperature has been elevated from November to April each year, beginning in November 1993. Each heated plot contains two 1000 W, 240-V AC heating cables secured to the soil surface in parallel runs spaced 50mmapart. Soil surface temperature of heated plots is maintained at 3°C above ambient by thermocouples in heated and control plots linked to a PC-based control system.

2. Rainfall has been intercepted above the vegetation throughout July and August since the summer of 1994 by means of automatically operating, semitransparent shelters that slide across the plots at the onset of rain and retreat to an off-plot position when rain ceases. Plots of intercepted summer rainfall have significantly reduced summer soil moisture levels compared with control plots, particularly within the interior 2 x 2 m subject to vegetation monitoring. In 2004, a decision was made to shift the drought treatment to alternate years (thus suspending simulated droughts in 2004 and 2006).

3. Since 1994, additional water has been added on a monthly basis to the plots during the months of June to September (inclusive), to maintain an input at least 20% above the long-term (1972–1982) Buxton average for each month.

In addition to treatments 1, 2, and 3, two combinations, (1&2) and (1&3),have been maintained. All five treatments, together with untreated controls, are included in a fully randomized block, replicated 5 times.",,"no need, one sample per year"

Samples were frozen, then sorted under magnification. Arthropods were generally identified to species or genus, but occasionally a morphological descriptive was used when identification was uncertain. Sample collection and sorting was done by John Haarstad.                                        Data preparation was begun by John Haarstad and Stephanie Pimm Lyon. It was completed by Colleen Satyshur, primarily using the access database that Stephanie prepared for Big Bio and which she used in preparing some of this data, but also using a CODE file J.Haarstad included with his latest data files. *Note about comparing experiments: morphological notes may not indicate the same species/group in different experiments.Thirty-two 20 x 20 m plots were established in field B in fall 2000 (see plot map). To reduce edge effects, each plot has a 5 m wide buffer zone along each interior side of the fence/edge. This leaves a central 10 x 10 m area (marked with orange-tipped rebar) in which most sampling takes place.

The experiment design is factorial, with treatments consisting of deer exclosure fences, nitrogen addition, and prescribed burning. Treatments assigned to each plot are found in the treatment table below. Within each plot there is also a 1 sq. m plowed area (located outside of the central 10 x 10 m area). Deer exclosure fences were constructed of 6 ft tall hardware cloth with an opening size of 2 x 4 in.

Aluminum flashing was stapled to the bases of fence posts to protect them from burning. All trees were removed from the 4 m wide area between plots, as well as the out perimeter of the experiment. This buffer provides space for fire vehicles during prescribed burns. Trees within plots that were large enough to pose a fire hazard were removed, as were large trees near fences. This reduced potential damage to the fences, while not disturbing the inner plot where most measurements are made.

The traps were set approximately halfway between each of the corner posts and slightly to the outside of the inner sampling area (see sampling diagram). Traps were labeled according to the side of the plot they were located on (N, S, E, W). Each week, traps were set out on Sunday after 4 PM, and picked up after the Friday evening survey. Traps were checked twice a day, starting at 6 AM and 6 PM (in 2004-5 checked only once a day). Baits were checked every morning, and replaced as necessary. A tight wad of vegetation approx 2? x 3.5? was used when trapping voles.

Any trap not physically capable of capturing animals (not sensitive enough, set off by deer, etc.) was recorded as NTAV (= no trap available) at the time that traps were checked. Captured individuals were recorded as a new capture (N) or a recapture (R). [?P? used for individuals marked in a previous trapping period.] New captures were weighed and tagged. When an individual was recaptured, the numbers on its ear tags were recorded and missing tags were replaced as necessary. Sex (M, F), age (J = Juvenile; usually all gray & small; A = Adult; usually all brown & large; S = Sub-adult; combination of both conditions; U = Unsure), species, and status at release (U = Released unharmed; C = Dead and collected; D = Dead but not collected; H = Hypothermic, treated &released; I = Injured in trap, released; E = Escaped unharmed) were also recorded, along with any unusual or important observations about the captured individual (e.g. deformities, extent of injuries, escapees, notes on burrow use, etc.).

We hypothesized that the response of this ecosystem to the combined effects of fire, N, and herbivory would depend on the ability of pine and other species to invade and the magnitude of their response to the different disturbance factors: warm-season grasses increase with and encourage fire, resist herbivores, and inhibit woody plant invasion (Davis et al. 1998, Inouye et al. 1994); cool-season plants are favored by N deposition (Tilman 1987) but are fire-intolerant and palatable to herbivores; legumes tolerate fire but decrease with herbivory and N deposition; and finally, woody plants are fire-intolerant and may be more susceptible to herbivory.

Methods: Three watershed units (C3A, C3B, C3C) constitute 'patches' that are alternately burned in a 3-year rotation within a single, fenced pasture (i.e., patch-burn grazing). Two additional watersheds are serving as controls: a grazed, annually/uniformly-burned watershed (C1A) and an ungrazed, annually/uniformly-burned watershed (1D). Grasshopper sampling is done by standardized sweeping with canvas beating nets 38 cm in diameter. A sample of 250 sweeps (ten sets of 25 sweeps each) is taken at each site (4 independent sites per watershed) on each occasion. A sweep is taken at each step by traversing an arc of 1805 with the net through the top layer of vegetation. After 25 such sweeps, the contents of the net are emptied into individual plastic bags. Air is squeezed out and samples are kept on ice until they can be later frozen that same day. Samples are sorted and identified to species and instar at a later date. Samples are taken between 1000 and 1500 hours on clear, calm warm days: cloud cover is less than 50%, wind speed less than 24km per hr (15 mph), and ambient air temperature should be 25-40oC.
