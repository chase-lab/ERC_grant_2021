# BioTIMEx

## Description
BioTIMEx data aggregation project aimed at gathering long term data, resembling
BioTIME typical data sets, but with sites naturally (flood, fire...) or 
artificially (grazing, temperature or precipitation manipulation) disturbed
compared to undisturbed sites.  
Thirteen data sets totalising 92 disturbed case studies in marine, freshwater
and terrestrial ecosystems; on birds, zooplankton, phytoplankton, invertebrates,
plants, mammals and fish.

## Data aggregation rules
Data sets were originally searched for among LTER data sets and suitable
open access data stored on EPI were selected

## Working status
Data last updated on March 8 2021.

## Publication status
Code available on GitHub [https://github.com/chase-lab/BioTIMEx](https://github.com/chase-lab/BioTIMEx).
Ready to be published on Zenodo. Should I proceed?
