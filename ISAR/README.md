# ISAR

## Description
<!---This is the Dryad repo abstract-->
The Island Species-Area Relationship (ISAR) quantifies how the number of species
increases as the area of an island or island-like habitat gets larger, and is
one of ecologyâ€™s most general patterns. However, studies that measure the ISAR
often confound variation in sampling methodology and analyses, precluding
appropriate syntheses of its underlying mechanisms. While most ISAR studies
only use presence-absence data at the whole-island scale, we aggregated data
sets of species-level abundances allowing for individual-based rarefaction.

505 islands from 34 different archipelagos across the world, including oceanic islands, lake islands and forest islands.

Local assemblages of plants, invertebrates, herpetofauna, birds and mammals.

## Data aggregation rules
<!---This is the Dryad repo abstract-->
Suitable data sets were searched for on online databases. Species lists and
abundances per island were extracted and organised in tables, one per data set
(author-name_year). Island area, coordinates, elevation and additional sampling
design information were also gathered from the articles. When area, elevation or
coordinates were missing, several sources were used to retrieve them as noted in
env_file_utf8.csv.

All independent data sets were then aggregated in one long format table for
further analysis, see the Zenodo archive for the R code.

The standardisation process is fully described in the associated manuscript by
Gooriah et al.
